ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @djulia-sevcenco

  I'm a physicist with a deep passion for understanding the fundamental laws of the universe.
  My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in university level physics, mathematics, C++, and ROOT.
  Now, I'm eager to apply and enhance my knowledge with modern machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and computational physics techniques.
  These tools are essential for modern physics research this is why I'm dedicated to mastering them to apply for the Master's program in Physics of Data.

ðŸ”¬ My Interests:

  - Physics: My first love, where I delve into the mysteries of the cosmos.
  - Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Tools that will allow me to unlock new insights and patterns in data.
  - Python: My go-to programming language for its versatility and power in scientific computing.
  - ROOT: Specialized software for data analysis in high-energy physics.
  - Research Institutions: Active follower of INFN, CERN, SISSA, and other leading research institutions.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently mastering Python, R, and following a course in "Computational Physics: Scientific Programming with Python" by @Dr.BÃ¶rgeGÃ¶bel un Udemy to strenghten my knowledge.

ðŸŒŸ Highlights

- Passionate about the intersection of physics and data science.
- Continuously learning and implementing ML and DL techniques.
- Engaged with the latest research and developments in Detector Physics, High Enerly Physics and also Physics of Matter and especially application of Computing for better understanding.

ðŸŽ“ My Goals

- Apply my skills and knowledge to the Physics of Data Master's program.
- Contribute to cutting-edge research and advancements in physics and data science.
- Collaborate with other enthusiasts and professionals in the field.
